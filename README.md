# Standardising metadata for insect images from camera traps and machine learning output

## Mapping InsectAI datasets to Camtrap DP

This repository is dedicated to testing the [suggested
modifications](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L6m0Z5kQDzlh2m68XGI1M6btXrI-xApqqgOhlzgxhRY/edit?tab=t.0)
to Camtrap DP by the InsectAI community. We aim to evaluate these
changes by mapping datasets to Camtrap DP.

This work is carried out as part of [Insect AI COST action](https://insectai.eu/): Using Image-based AI for Insect Monitoring & Conservation
